## Response: *Notes on "Camp"* - Susan Sontag

<!--Possible numbers to respond to?

5. "And movie criticism (like lists of "The 10 Best Bad Movies I Have Seen") is probably the greatest popularizer of Camp taste today, because most people still go to the movies in a high-spirited and unpretentious way." (p. 3)
  Reminds me of Watch Mojo lists and tangentially, Burger King Foot Lettuce meme.

4. "Random examples of items which are part of the canon of Camp:...The Brown Derby retraurant on Sunset Boulevard in LA..." (p. 2)
  Reminds me of the big chair in Door County.

18. "One must distinguish between naive and deliberate Camp. Pure Camp is always naive. Camp which knows itself to be Camp ('camping') is usually less satisfying."
  Cocaine Bear!

23. "In naive, or pure, Camp, the essential element is seriousness, a seriousness that fails. Of course, not all seriousness that fails can be redeemed as Camp. Only that which has the proper mixture of the exaggerated, the fantastic, the passionate, and the naive."

24. "When something is just bad (rather than Camp), it's often because it is too mediocre in its ambition. The artist hasn't attempted to do anything really outlandish. ('It's too much,' 'It's too fantastic,' 'It's not to be believed,' are standard phrases of Camp enthusiasm.)"
  Reminds me of the Karlie Kloss MET Gala meme. (Both 23 & 24)

56. "Camp taste is a kind of love, love for human nature. It relishes, rather than judges, the little triumphs and awkward intensities of 'character.'...Camp taste identifies with what it is enjoying. People who share this sensibility are not laughing at the thing they label as 'a camp,' they're enjoying it. Camp is a *tender* feeling."
