# Sci-Fi & Speculative Design

Science fiction comments/critiques our present by imagining worlds based off of specific problems. Sci-fi asks the "what if?" questions that can help us see the possible dangers or benefits of certain technologies, social progressions, or ideas in our current discourses. The three artists I read about are as follows:
1. Andrea Zittel  
2. Marjetica Potrc  
3. JAM, aka Jane Palmer and Marianne Fairbanks  
 
These works are a kind of science fiction because they ask the same "what if?" questions, but bring it into the real world as opposed to imagining worlds that exist within the confines of one's imagination. Imagining alternative futures for the world helps to guide social progression and help people to imagine new types of living.
