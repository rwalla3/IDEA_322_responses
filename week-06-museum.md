### Museum response  

My museum would be more of a personal exploration of the various materials I've been collecting, a lot of which are "recyclables" like packaging plastics, bottle caps, cardboard, etc. It would function as a way to visualize these materials in a cohesive way and hopefully inspire works. I think it would be less of a "museum" and more of a collection of curiosities and a tool for further artistic expression. I'm inspired by the Learning Machines of George Maciunas as a display model as well as the structure of the "museum". A name for it could be "RE" or "The Museum of RE" (as in recycle, reuse, repurpose, etc.)
